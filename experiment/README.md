## Toonotopy Experiment ##

This folder consists of all the functions and routines for running the Toonotopy (cartoon retinotopy) experiment. 


#### Instructions for running Toonotopy on MATLAB ####
Open Matlab. Add path to experiment folder. Then type "wfret" to setup the stimuli. It will take a while for the stimuli to load. A menu will pop up with some parameters. Use all default parameters by pressing okay. The code will then ask if you would like to eyetrack. Press 1 if you have a good image of the eye, and 0 if you don't. If you are eyetracking, you will get a popup window suggesting an edf file name (wifi may need to be turned off if using Eyelink). Because the cursor is hidden, you'll need to press tab and then enter to use the edf file name. When the stimuli are loaded and the Inplane has finished, adjust MRI setup and callibrate eyetracking if using.
